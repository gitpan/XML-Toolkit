0.07 2010-01-30T01:27:35
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - forgot some diagnostics in a test

 - clean up POD, examples, and tests

 - update RNG example

 - add updated XML::AIML

 - kill old xmltk_make_classes

 - clean up the basic test

 - fix up tests before release

 - remove the YP oriented tests cause *stevan* thought they were a bad
   idea. (He is right)

 - clean up the XML namespaces for yp-api.t

 - build a new example based on XSPF
   
   going through and building a new example using the XSPF file for a
   client, I had to perform some cleanup of how generate and the
   templates work.
   
   The templates have been unified into XML::Toolkit;:Cmd::ClassTemplate
   with the generate command wrapping it with the logic to break stuff out.
   This cleans up some nastiness and makes the templates more uniform.
   
   we're also adding a test for XSPF round tripping.

 - fix to run with the current Moose and MooseX::MetaDescription
   
   Moose 0.94 introduced some changes to the way Attributes are handled in
   Roles. As a side effect the Attribute inheritance no longer works in
   Role -> Role composition. We copy the Attribute now until this is fixed
   in Moose.
   
   Also patch a few tests to deal with the changes that have happened in
   the codebase that we didn't detect before.

 - * add test for yp-api
   
   We needed to have RDF support for the YP Feed API. This adds a test that
   slurps the current version of the API XML so we can round-trip it.
   
   * get the XML tests passing
   
   The `namespace_map` for the Generator has to be different from the ones
   for the Loader and Builder. We fix the test for this, fix the code to
   reflect the changes, and everything magically works.
   
   * clean up the logic from the unresolve_namespaces flow
   
   change the logic (and wording) to "unless no_unresolved_namespaces"
   rather than "if unresovled_namespaces" since we're checking if the list
   "is_empty"

 - remove the need for MooseX::AttributeHelpers
   
   MX::AH was folded into core. This removes all of the places we use
   MX::AH I think in both the processing code, and the generated code.

 - clean up generated code and tests
   
   The Generated code was using MooseX::AttributeHelpers which has been
   folded into core. We fix that to use Native::Attribute's now. We also
   move to use nammespace::clean.
   
   We also start moving the tests to use `done_testing` instead of no_plan.
   
   Finally we fix the Filter to properly add the XML trait to text nodes as
   well as non-text ones, this squishes some warnings.

 - fix add_text_attribute to include 'XML::Toolkit::MetaDescription::Trait'
   
   We need to be sure that the generated classes have the right
   meta-description trait. We were getting a warning for the text
   attributes when generating them, this should fix that.
