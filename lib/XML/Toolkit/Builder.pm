=head1 NAME

XML::Toolkit::Builder - A set of tools for Building XML Classes via XML::SAX Streams

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use XML::Toolkit::Builder;

    my $builder = XML::Toolkit::Builder->new(
        filter => $filter,
        parser => XML::SAX::ParserFactory->new( Handler => $filter ),
    );
    
    $self->builder->parse_file( $file );
    say $builder->render;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item filter - An XML::SAX Filter

The render method is required. This is the class that renders the parsed
events into a set of Moose classes. XML::Toolkit::Builder::Filter documented
elsewhere in this distribution is the default implementation.

=item parser - A Parser Object

The methods parse_uri, parse_file and parse_string are required. This defaults
to a XML::SAX::ParserFactory parser.
